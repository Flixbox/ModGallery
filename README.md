Mods and maps are managed in the [ModGallery-mods](https://github.com/Flixbox/ModGallery-Mods) repo. Feel free to add mods and maps! There's a guide in that repo's readme.

> **Unimportant nerd stuff ahead, no need to continue reading. Here are the [downloads](https://github.com/Flixbox/ModGallery/releases)**

## üë©‚Äçüíª Development

- Install Node.js
- Run `npm i --force`
- Run `npm run watch`

## üöÄ Release

- Push to `main`
- Wait for the CI
- This will create a draft release
- Keep all the files when editing the release
- Finalize the release

## üç´ Choco

Sometimes it may be helpful to release the most recent version to Chocolatey. The application will auto update on the user's machines regardless of version, but having a halfway recent version on Chocolatey is helpful regardless.

Here's how the update process happens:

- Make sure you can authenticate on Chocolatey with write access to modgallery on the site
- Install Chocolatey
- Authenticate
- Navigate to `/scripts/choco/ModGallery`
- Open `scripts/chocolateyinstall.ps1`
- Adjust `$url` so that it points to the newest release
- Adjust `checksum` (use the `checksum` command to calculate it from the executable setup file)
- Open an admin PowerShell in the directory
- Run `choco pack` to build a new version of the application
- Run `choco install modgallery --source .\modgallery.<version>.nupkg -y` (adjust path to your version)
- Check if the software installed properly (might need to refresh windows or run `refreshenv` to see it pop up)
- Run and try out the software
- Close it again
- Run `choco uninstall modgallery -y`
- Check if the software uninstalled properly (might need to refresh windows or run `refreshenv`)
- If it's all ready to release, run `choco push --source https://push.chocolatey.org/`
